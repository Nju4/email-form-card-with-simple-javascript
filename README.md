## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot from here, especially the javascript problem which I understand quite well but it is difficult to apply especially on the computer I use. I learned to use .value and how to connect a button from html to javascript.

### Continued development

I will practice more in this javascript problem, especially events and others that sometimes I forget to make.
